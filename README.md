# BJS-2025

Welcome to **BJS-2025**!

This is a game developed for a Beginner Game Jam. The goal was to create a complete, playable project with little prior experience in game development and to learn new skills along the way.

## About the Game

**BJS-2025** is a Horror Plattformer where you have to find a way out of the endless Timeloops. The game was built from scratch within the time constraints of the Game Jam.


## Goals & Motivation

The Beginner Game Jam was a great opportunity to learn the basics of game development: from planning and brainstorming to implementing gameplay logic and presenting a finished project.


## Thanks

A big thank you to the organizers of the Beginner Game Jam and everyone who provided feedback and support!
